# Milestone 2: Language Development  
**Develop and Test the Enhanced Aiken Marketplace Contract Features**

## Milestone Outputs
A set of developed and newly developed Aiken-lang smart contract features and functions. These enhancements will improve the NFT marketplace, Swap DEX performance, reduce operational costs, and enhance functionality within the Cardano marketplace ecosystem.

## Key Focus Areas

### Prioritize Features

1. **Developer Experience**  
   Aiken is designed to be easy to learn and use, drawing inspiration from modern languages like Gleam, Rust, and Elm.  

2. **Robustness**  
   Aiken prioritizes security and reliability for smart contracts, with tools for review, audit, and static analysis of code.  

3. **Focus on Cardano**  
   Tailored specifically for Cardano, Aiken provides high-quality tools to develop secure, reliable contracts on the Cardano blockchain.  

4. **Simplicity and Manageability**  
   The language remains small and focused to reduce complexity and vulnerabilities.  

### Feature Design

Aiken's development centers around:

1. **Developer Experience**
    - Type safety
    - Functional programming paradigm
    - Clear syntax
    - Rich standard library

2. **Robustness for Smart Contracts**
    - Immutability
    - Formal verification
    - Resource management
    - Access control  

### Example of Feature Design in Aiken

#### Feature: Type Safety

```rust
fn validate_input(value: Integer) -> Bool {
    if value > 0 {
        True
    } else {
        False
    }
}
```

This ensures that the input is valid by checking if it's a positive integer.

---

## Coding Standards

Aiken emphasizes simplicity and smart contract security:

- **Standard Library Reference**: Review the Aiken standard library for examples of idiomatic and secure code.  
- **Community Resources**: Participate in the Aiken-lang GitHub discussions and Reddit for best practices.  
- **General Smart Contract Security**: Apply common security principles for smart contract development.

---

## Development Process

The development of new features follows strict adherence to functional and non-functional requirements. All features must be thoroughly tested to ensure compatibility and performance within the Cardano ecosystem.

### Test Plan Overview

The test plan includes unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests of the developed Aiken functions.

1. **Developed Features & Functions**:  
   Test all existing and new functions developed using Aiken.  

2. **Test Result Documentation**:  
   Provide detailed test results, showcasing unit, integration, and performance testing outcomes.

#### Example Test Case

```rust
test validate_input_test() {
    assert validate_input(10) == True
    assert validate_input(-1) == False
}
```

This is an example of a unit test written in Aiken to validate the `validate_input` function.

---

## Testing Phases

1. **Unit Testing**:  
   Aiken's built-in unit testing framework helps ensure individual functions work as intended.

    ```shell
    aiken check
    ```

   The `aiken check` command executes all tests and generates a report.

2. **Integration Testing**:  
   Ensures all marketplace features interact smoothly, verifying data flow and state consistency.

3. **Performance Testing**:  
   Evaluates the efficiency and impact of new features under varying conditions.

---

## Testing Documentation

Comprehensive documentation will be generated, including test plans, results, and any issues identified and resolved during development.

1. **Unit Testing Example**:

    ```shell
    aiken check --unit-tests
    ```

2. **Integration Testing Results**:

    ```shell
    aiken check --integration-tests
    ```

3. **Performance Testing**:

    ```shell
    aiken check --performance-tests
    ```

---

## Feature Documentation

Detailed feature documentation should be created, providing clear usage examples, integration guidance, and best practices.

#### Example of Function Documentation

```rust
/// Function to validate input
/// - value: Integer to be validated
/// Returns: Boolean indicating if the value is valid.
fn validate_input(value: Integer) -> Bool {
    // code here
}
```

---

## Peer Review

An in-depth review of Aiken's capabilities, especially for marketplace smart contracts, must be conducted to evaluate the following:

- **Security**: Reentrancy protection, secure randomness, and integer overflow/underflow prevention.  
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with Cardano's native tokens, NFTs, and oracles.  
- **Code Readability**: Maintaining clean, concise, and maintainable code.  

### Peer Review Example: Reentrancy Attack Prevention

```rust
fn secure_transaction(amount: Integer) -> Bool {
    let balance_before = get_balance()
    let success = perform_transaction(amount)
    let balance_after = get_balance()
    success && (balance_before == balance_after)
}
```

This example checks balances before and after a transaction to prevent reentrancy attacks.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **General Functionality**:  
   Must meet asset management, escrow, and offer management requirements, along with handling fees and access control securely.

2. **Security**:  
   Pass rigorous security tests for reentrancy protection and overflow prevention.

3. **Interoperability**:  
   Features must integrate with Cardano native tokens, NFTs, and oracles effectively.

### Example: Secure Asset Management

```rust
fn transfer_asset(asset: Asset, from: Address, to: Address) -> Result {
    if check_ownership(asset, from) {
        initiate_transfer(asset, to)
    } else {
        Error("Not authorized")
    }
}
```

This feature ensures proper asset management with secure ownership verification.
